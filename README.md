### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Vlad Frangu, a full-stack developer from Bucharest! :sparkles: I'm a very fast learner in most programming languages; with focus on: [`TypeScript`] (and JavaScript :eyes:), [`Kotlin`], [`Rust`], [`Vue`] (and possibly [`React`]), with TSX, of course :smile:

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: anything you want, as long as it isn't offensive to anyone
- âš¡ Fun fact: I learn the fastest by diving head first into a problem / new thing, NOT by researching it first

#### ðŸ“« How to reach me

#### ðŸ”­ Projects

I tend to pick up a lot of projects as time passes, mainly due to wanting to help others :sweat_smile:

- :rainbow_flag: [`pfp.lgbt`] - a simple UI to add pride flags to your images or GIFs
- ðŸ‘¯ [`DumbDogDiner`] - a team building Minecraft plugins for our own Minecraft server (or yours if you want to use them :thumbs_up:)
