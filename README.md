### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Vlad Frangu, a full-stack developer from Bucharest! :sparkles: I'm a very fast learner in most programming languages; with focus on: [TypeScript](typescript) (and JavaScript :eyes:), [Kotlin](kotlin), [Rust](rustlang), [Vue](vue) (and possibly [React](react)), with TSX, of course :smile:

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: anything you want, as long as it isn't offensive to anyone
- âš¡ Fun fact: I learn the fastest by diving head first into a problem / new thing, NOT by researching it first

#### ðŸ”­ Projects

I tend to pick up a lot of projects as time passes, mainly due to wanting to help others :sweat_smile:
